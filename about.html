        <h2>Hello! Iâ€™m Owen!</h2>
        <p>
          I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer currently studying in the HACC
          Web Development Program. My journey in web development started with
          HTML and CSS, and it has since expanded to include JavaScript
          frameworks, PHP, and even Python for backend work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy solving complex problems, building interactive user
          interfaces, and continually learning new technologies. My goal is to
          become proficient in both front-end and back-end development, so I can
          create seamless full-stack applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I love to explore design software like Adobe XD and
          dive into new programming languages.
